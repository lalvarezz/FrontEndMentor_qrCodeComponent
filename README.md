## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I'm still learning about css and html, however, it was nice to remember a little bit of the display:flex property, since I haven't practiced in a while. Playing with width percentaje and is important in order to understand how our page will show the content.


### Continued development

I want to learn more about how to display aesthetically my webpage content, also I would like to deeply understand how flexbos works, in order to create responsive websites.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1.](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) - This helped me to remember how does display:flex works.
